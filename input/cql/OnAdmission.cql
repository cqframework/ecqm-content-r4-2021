How do we make use of the DiagnosisPresentOnAdmission extension to determine whether
a diagnosis was present on admission?

/*
The issue I see is that the use of authoredOn implies this will only work for prescriptions that are recorded on admission
It's not clear that MedicationRequest would be used for that purpose, that seems like more of a MedicationStatement use case
Further, if MedicationRequest records are available from the patient record, we would need to use something like the
CumulativeMedicationDuration logic to look at all MedicationRequest, and potentially dispense records to dtermine whether
this is a medication that is "active":
