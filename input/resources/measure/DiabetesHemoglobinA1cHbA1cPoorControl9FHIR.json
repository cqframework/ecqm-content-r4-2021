  "rationale": "Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. In 2017, diabetes affected approximately 34 million Americans (10.5 percent of the U.S. population) and killed approximately 84,000 people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020a). Diabetes is a long-lasting disease marked by high blood glucose levels, resulting from the body's inability to produce or use insulin properly (CDC, 2020a). People with diabetes are at increased risk of serious health complications including vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and amputation of feet or legs (CDC, 2018). \n\nIn 2017, diabetes cost the U.S. an estimated $327 billion: $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity. This is a 34 percent increase from the estimated $245 billion spent on diabetes in 2012 (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2018).  \n\nControlling A1c blood levels helps reduce the risk of microvascular complications (eye, kidney and nerve diseases) (ADA, 2020).",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "American Diabetes Association (2020):\n\n- An A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate. (Level of evidence: A)\n\n- On the basis of provider judgement and patient preference, achievement of lower A1C goals (such as <6.5%) may be acceptable if this can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. (Level of evidence: C)\n\n- Less stringent A1C goals (such as <8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing diabetes in whom the goal is difficult to achieve despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.
